#+title: Building JOCL for Cashmere

* Introduction

In this document we describe how to build JOCL for [[https://github.com/junglecomputing/cashmere][Cashmere]].  Cashmere uses
some features of JOCL that have not been released yet.  Hence, we build our own
version from a fork of [[https://github.com/junglecomputing/JOCL][JOCL]].  The modifications are minor, only changing the
groupID such that we can publish it on [[https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter][JCenter]].  This git repository uses
submodules to obtain the source code for the JOCL forks in the directory
~JOCLRoot~.

* Checking out the repositories

We can check out the repositories with:

#+begin_src sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
#+end_src

* Building the native code

We build the native code with the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
mkdir JOCLRoot/JOCL.build
cd JOCLRoot/JOCL.build
cmake ../JOCL
make
#+end_src

* Building the java files

We can only run the tests if there is a GPU in the machine, otherwise add we
~-DskipTests~.  

#+begin_src sh
cd ../JOCL
mvn clean package -DskipTests
#+end_src
